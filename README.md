# Privilege-Escalation-Framework
Privilege Escilation training project, with an emphasis on the distinction between vulnerability research & it's exposure and exploitation methods(which are CVE-independent.)

I aim to show how generic exploitation methods could be developed for various vulnerability types.

I currently paused the work on this project (there is so much I want to explore and so little time... need to do some prioritizing), after implemnating only one generic exploitation method, the self-reference trick for Windows OSs.
Please read about it in my vulnerability research notebook:

Good day!
